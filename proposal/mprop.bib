abstract = {For the first time since the establishment of TCP and UDP, the Internet transport layer is subject to a major change by the introduction of QUIC. Initiated by Google in 2012, QUIC provides a reliable, connection-oriented low-latency and fully encrypted transport. In this paper, we provide the first broad assessment of QUIC usage in the wild. We monitor the entire IPv4 address space since August 2016 and about 46{\%} of the DNS namespace to detected QUIC-capable infrastructures. Our scans show that the number of QUIC-capable IPs has more than tripled since then to over 617.59 K. We find around 161K domains hosted on QUIC-enabled infrastructure, but only 15K of them present valid certificates over QUIC. Second, we analyze one year of traffic traces provided by MAWI, one day of a major European tier-1 ISP and from a large IXP to understand the dominance of QUIC in the Internet traffic mix. We find QUIC to account for 2.6{\%} to 9.1{\%} of the current Internet traffic, depending on the vantage point. This share is dominated by Google pushing up to 42.1{\%} of its traffic via QUIC.},

@article{Bhat2017,
abstract = {Despite known QoE shortcomings, Dynamic Adaptive Stream-ing over HTTP (DASH) has been tied with TCP for many years now. The advent of HTTP/2 powered by transport protocols such as QUIC provides an excellent opportunity to revisit adaptive bitrate streaming with respect to QoE. QUIC promises improved congestion control, zero-RTT connection establishment and multiplexing logical streams. In this work, we adapt state-of-the-art DASH players with buffer-based and hybrid (rate/buffer-based) quality adaptation logic to use QUIC. Our main focus lies in contrasting the QoE perfor-mance of DASH algorithms running on top of QUIC versus TCP in various environments. Interestingly, we find through testbed and Internet measurements that QUIC does not provide a boost to current DASH algorithms but instead a degradation in the chosen quality bitrates.},
annote = {QUIC does not improve DASH algorithms in their current state compared to TCP, causes a degredation in chosen quality instead. Doesn't seem to make any modifications to DASH, just highlights that QUIC should not be treated as a direct replacement to TCP.

Worth reading to see if any issues described here could cause problems for RTP over QUIC.

@article{Palmer2018,
abstract = {Within a few years of its introduction, QUIC has gained traction: a significant chunk of traffic is now delivered over QUIC. The networking community is actively engaged in debating the fairness, performance, and applicability of QUIC for various use cases, but these debates are centered around a narrow, common theme: how does the new reliable transport built on top of UDP fare in different scenarios? Support for unreliable delivery in QUIC remains largely unexplored. The option for delivering content unreliably, as in a best-effort model, deserves the QUIC designers' and community's attention. We propose extending QUIC to support unreliable streams and present a simple approach for implementation. We discuss a simple use case of video streaming---an application that dominates the overall Internet traffic---that can leverage the unreliable streams and potentially bring immense benefits to network operators and content providers. To this end, we present a prototype implementation that, by using both the reliable and unreliable streams in QUIC, outperforms both TCP and QUIC in our evaluations.},

@article{Liang2002,
abstract = {By conventional wisdom dating back to the genesis of the Internet, TCP is not suitable for real- time applications because it favors reliability over timeliness. The result has been a proliferation of application-specific and candidate real-time transport protocols, none of which has achieved the matu- rity and acceptance of TCP. To our knowledge, there has not been much prior study to ask the basic engineering question: What changes in TCP and its use would be required to allow it to be used for real-time network applications of interest? In this paper, we investigate exactly this question. Our testbed-based and public Internet experiment results show that the combination of a relatively modest extension to TCP, what we call real-time mode (RTM), and several application techniques allow real-time applications to operate well over TCP, mak- ing all the benefits of TCP, including error recovery, available to the real-time application developers. The TCP-RTM approach also leads to real-time applications that are responsive to network congestion, sharing the network resources fairly with other TCP applications. 1},

abstract = {Real-time multimedia applications use either TCP or UDP at the transport layer, yet neither of these protocols offer all of the features required. Deploying a new protocol that does offer these features is made difficult by ossification: firewalls, and other middleboxes, in the network expect TCP or UDP, and block other types of traffic. We present TCP Hollywood, a protocol that is wire-compatible with TCP, while offering an unordered, partially reliable message-oriented transport service that is well suited to multimedia applic-ations. Analytical results show that TCP Hollywood extends the feasibility of using TCP for real-time multimedia applications, by reducing latency and increasing utility. Preliminary evaluations also show that TCP Hollywood is deployable on the public Internet, with safe failure modes. Measurements across all major UK fixed-line and cellular networks validate the possibility of deployment.},

abstract = {Real-time applications require a set of transport services not cur- rently provided by widely-deployed transport protocols. Ossification prevents the deployment of novel protocols, restricting solutions to protocols using either TCP or UDP as a substrate. We describe the transport services required by real-time applications. We show that, in the short-term (i.e., while UDP is blocked at current levels), TCP offers a feasible substrate for providing these services. Over the longer term, protocols using UDP may reduce the number of networks blocking UDP, enabling a shift towards its use as a demultiplexing layer for novel transport protocols.},
